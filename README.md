# hangman
Hangman is a word game to find the word within several blank spaces.

The blank spaces represent the missing letters you need to guess.

# Instructions
Use the keyboard to guess a letter (It's case-insensitive).
If you guess the letter correctly, it will reveal all the letters in the answer.

Guess incorrectly, and you will lose a life.
Find the word before you run out of lives.
